# ultrasound-app-fullstack

## Overview
This app was developed for a fellowship program through my local hospital. It provides an intuative and organized user interface for navagating 3000+ .mp4 files used for educational purposes. 

Created with React JS + Spring Boot + MongoDB. The app utilizes Spring Security for JWT authentication and the enforcement of role-based routing and privelages.

[Frontend code](https://github.com/CalebTracey/ultrasound-app-fullstack/tree/main/src/main/react-client)

[Backend code](https://github.com/CalebTracey/ultrasound-app-fullstack/tree/main/src/main/java/com/ultrasound/app)

## Usage
If you would like to try out the app for yourself, follow the steps below. You will need to create a collection in mongodb called "roles" and add documents "ROLE_USER" and optionally "ROLE_ADMIN" as shown here:
<img src=./document-example.png />
<br />
If you want to use the admin privelages, uncomment the @CommandlineRunner method in the application's main method and login with the same credentials.
Also, make sure your application.properties file is configured as such:
<img src=./app.properties-example-local.png />

1. Fork/clone this repo

2. Download [Docker Desktop App](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

3. Run the [Docker Compose](./docker-compose.yaml) file found in the root directory.

4. Access the Mongo Express UI at: [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/)

5. Create the "roles" collection as mentioned above.

6. Access the app on [localhost:80](http://localhost:80/) and register!

## Available Scripts
If you would rather skip the Docker proccess for the front/backend, follow the steps below. you still need to run the docker-compose file to get mongodb running locally, so just comment out the frontend/backend sections in the file.
<br />
<br />
`mvn spring-boot:run`
<br />
<br />
for the client, navigate to "react-client" and run:
<br />
<br />
`yarn start`
<br />
<br />
Then use the app locally on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
<br />
